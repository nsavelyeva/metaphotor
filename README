MetaPhotor is a web-application to serve as a small media-centre for personal and family photos and videos.

Reason:
  * I wanted to keep family photos & videos on a home server and search through them from a browser - by tags, locations, etc.
  * Moreover, I wanted my metadata changes to metadata to be stored inside the media files in order to let them survive after copying/moving files.
  * I got inspired by EXIF and FFMPEG, Highcharts + Highmaps, and Mapping APIs.

Tools:
  * Back-end: Flask microframework on the top of Python 3, modules geopy, PIL & piexif, multiprocessing.dummy for threading, argparse & logging.
  * Database: SQLite (which is inbuilt in Python) + SQLAlchemy
  * Front-end: Bootstrap + jQuery + Font Awesome + higcharts & highmaps. All from CDN.

Features:
  * Discover photo and video files on the local storage and display the ongoing scan progress.
  * Sophisticated search for media files based on their metadata - with tags autocompletion support.
  * Read/Modify metadata inside photo and video files.
  * Statistics in the form of pie charts and histograms.
  * Geo positioning of a photo/video on the map.
  * Ownership support for media files:
      - scanned files are considered as common for all users including anonymous;
      - uploaded files are considered as owned by an (authenticated) uploader.
  * Listing media files:
      - pagination;
      - carousel, thumbnails and table views;
      - pop-10: popular (most visited) media files;
      - new-10: last created media files;
      - fresh-10: last updated media files;
      - lov-10: favourite media files (owned & popular).
  * Besides MediaFiles, support of CRUD-operations for Locations, Users, Tags.
  * Web interface to manage application settings.
  * Support options to launch MetaPhotor from command line and application logging.
